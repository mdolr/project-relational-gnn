description: "Many important real-world datasets come in the form of graphs or networks: social networks,
knowledge graphs, protein-interaction networks, the World Wide Web, etc. (just to name a few).
Yet, until recently, very little attention has been devoted to the generalization of neural network
models to such structured datasets. Recent works (see [1,2,3]) show the possibility of using
convolutional nets on graphs. In this project, we are interested in lifting these approaches to
multi-relational data. In particular, we are interested in applying such methods to data issued from
open educational resources."
