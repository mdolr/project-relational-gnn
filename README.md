# Relational Graph Neural Network

A short research project from my 1st year of masters degree. The goal was to try to implement and capture the importance of edges properties in graph neural networks to build a recommendation system capable of helping in building custom and adapted learning path when using open-source educational resources provided by the X5Gon platforms
